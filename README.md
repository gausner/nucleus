# Setup the project and install dependencies #

- Clone the project
- Go to the project directory
- Run `npm install`

# Run the code #

- `npm start` will run the application in debug mode. We will use it most of the time
- `npm run dist` to package in a distributable format (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package)) 
- `npm run pack` (only generates the package directory without really packaging it. This is useful for testing purposes).
